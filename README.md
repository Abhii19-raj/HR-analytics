# HR-analytics
Data analytics project showcasing HR analysis using  Power BI, Power Query and DAX
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand attrition patterns, workforce trends, and key HR metrics. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was built to help HR teams and management make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and workforce planning.

The dashboard transforms raw HR data into meaningful insights about why employees leave, which departments are most affected, and how factors like age, salary, and job role influence attrition.
